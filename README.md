# Insta Bot Creator
Python script automating the creation of Instagram accounts in large quantities, using fictitious email addresses.

**Warning**: Use of the Residential Proxy mandatory


## Use
To use the script you need Firefox, Python3 and Webdriver installed.

Installation of libraries :
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Error
**Error known for the moment** (but normally the script works) :
If creating the account worked, it will save it to the corresponding files, but if an error occurs (for example, Instagram asks for verification with a phone number, I don't have anything to bypass that at the moment) it will will also save it to files.

Waiting for residential proxies for testing to resolve issues.
